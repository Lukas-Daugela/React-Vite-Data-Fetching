# Data Fetching
One more project with data fetching from API. Also implemented pagination and sorting functions.    
Tried to code the whole project using Typescript. I know that it's not perfect, but I have learned a lot about it.

Project is made using:
- "React" library
- "Vite" build tool
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- SASS

# Quick Start
1. Install Node.js.
2. Clone the app:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lukas-Daugela/react-vite-Reiz-Tech-Assignment.git
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
cd react-vite-Reiz-Tech-Assignment
npm install
```
4. Run the development server:
```
npm start
```
5. Open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser (It should open automatically).
